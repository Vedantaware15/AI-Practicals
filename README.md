Roll no:381071
PRN no: 22320077
This repository contains various AI-based algorithms and implementations. Each assignment focuses on a key area of artificial intelligence, providing hands-on experience with important concepts like search algorithms, game strategies, and logical reasoning.

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for 8-Puzzle Problem
Implemented DFS and BFS algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The algorithms explore different possible moves to reach the goal state from an initial configuration.

### 2. Constraint Satisfaction Problem
This implementation solves a constraint satisfaction problem by exploring possible assignments that satisfy all constraints. It includes techniques like backtracking and forward checking to optimize the search.

### 3. Parsing a Family Tree using a Knowledge Base
Developed a parser to create and traverse a family tree using logical statements in a knowledge base. Queries related to family relationships are answered based on predefined facts and rules.

### 4. A* Algorithm for an Application
Implemented the A* search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a specific application. The algorithm uses both path cost and heuristic estimates to find the optimal solution.

### 5. Minimax Algorithm for Game Playing
This program implements the Minimax algorithm for decision-making in a two-player game. The algorithm simulates all possible moves to find the optimal strategy for the AI player.

### 6. Basic Search Strategies for the 8-Queens Problem
Implemented basic search algorithms to solve the 8-queens problem. The solution ensures no two queens threaten each other on the board.

### 7. Forward Chaining Algorithm
A forward chaining algorithm is implemented to infer new facts from a given knowledge base. It iteratively applies inference rules to derive conclusions from known facts.

### 8. Backward Chaining Algorithm
This implementation of the backward chaining algorithm works by starting from a goal and working backward to infer the necessary facts. It is used to determine if a goal can be derived from a set of rules and facts.

### 9. Chatbot Application for a Real-World Scenario
Developed a chatbot application for handling customer service queries in a real-world scenario. The chatbot uses basic natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries.





# Deep Learning Assignments

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models and applications using TensorFlow and Keras. The assignments cover topics such as neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing.

### 1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) in Python using Keras and TensorFlow
Implemented a simple feedforward neural network for binary classification using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset to classify input data into two categories.

### 2. Facial Recognition using OpenCV and Deep Learning for Binary Classification
Developed a facial recognition system using OpenCV and a deep learning model for binary classification. The model detects and classifies faces into predefined categories (e.g., authorized or unauthorized).

### 3. Image Classification using CNNs for Multiclass Classification
Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multiclass classification of images. The model is trained to classify images into multiple categories based on the features it extracts.

### 4. Time Series Prediction using RNN â€“ Stock Market Analysis or Weather Forecasting
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to perform time series prediction, applied to either stock market analysis or weather forecasting. The model learns patterns in historical data to make future predictions.

### 5. Text Identification using OpenCV, Tesseract (OCR), and Deep Neural Network
This project combines OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to identify and extract text from images. A deep neural network further enhances the text recognition process.

### 6. Sentiment Analysis using LSTM or GRU Networks
Implemented sentiment analysis on text data using an LSTM or GRU network. The model predicts the sentiment of input text as either positive, negative, or neutral.

### 7. Object Detection using YOLO and Pretrained Models
Developed an object detection model using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm with a pretrained model. The system identifies and locates objects within images in real-time.
